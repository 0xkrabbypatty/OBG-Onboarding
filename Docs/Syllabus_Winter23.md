## OBG Onboarding Syllabus
Much thanks to the open source blockchain community for all of the resources used in this course! 

# Objectives
- Revamp Fall22 onboarding to spend less time on background/history of cryptography, and more on why blockchains are resilient networks. Spend less time on the past and more on the present!

# [Week1]: Introduction + The Cathedral & The Bazaar
- Member introductions 
- OBG club overview
- OBG onboarding syllabus
- Mental model for the course: The Cathedral & The Bazaar
- If time permits: The cypherpunks
###### Homework: Read [this series](https://pet3rpan.medium.com/history-of-things-before-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-part-one-e199f02ca380)

# [Week2]: The Bazaar: Problems with building credibly neutral software platforms
- What types of censorship, proprietary software, and siloed data do we see/interact with?
- Explicit censorship but also soft censorship like shadowbans etc... 
- The characteristics of the bazaar (ie: the commons!)
- How do we build a software platform that emulates all the characteristics of the Bazaar?
- Network effects
- How do we decentralize data ownership?
- Problems with decentralizing data: Privacy, Scaling, and not building surveillance technology
###### Homework: [This thread](https://twitter.com/musalbas/status/1143629828551270401?s=20&t=4VEMiLBBgyaQ5pIiJzo-qw)

# [Week3]: Blockchain Overview: Nodes, Authorities, Hardconsensus & Softconsensus
- What is a software protocol (Email, HTTP, TCP/IP)
- Protocol specification, clients, and core devs
- What are the different nodes?
- How do you access the network?
- Consensus between blockproducers vs consensus between community
- Separation of powers
- The state transition function
- Forks
- Blockchains are a decentralized protocol for the ordering and inclusion of transactions (must build state off-chain)
- Comparison to the client-server model & other p2p networks
###### Homework: Dig around in the ethereum protocol repo

# [Week4]: Blockchain Technicals: History of BFT & Chain-based consensus, the scaling problem, how to run a node
- History of cryptography
- History of consensus
- Different approaches to blockchains: consensus (BFT vs. Chain-based), sybil (PoW vs. PoS), execution (VMs), and data availability (on-chain vs. off-chain)
- [The scaling problem](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html) & state-bloat
- [What you can do on-chain](https://twitter.com/joe314158/status/1610043518558535680?s=20&t=EuO2qS5H6riwj8kY2ZupbQ)
- How to run a node
- How does the average person access the network
###### Homework: Run a node

# [Week5]: Blockchain Applications: Revisiting the Bazaar and the current state of Blockchains
- How dapps work: frontend vs backend
- What is on-chain vs. offchain
- Orderflow + how your keys interact with dapps
- Upgradeable contracts
- Revisiting scaling and the economics of why dapps mostly suck (if you aren't a trader)
- The endgame for dapps and fullnodes
###### Homework: Download metamask + use uniswap
