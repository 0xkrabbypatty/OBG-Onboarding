## OBG Onboarding Syllabus
Much thanks to the open source blockchain community for all of the resources used in this course! 

# Objectives
- Revamp Fall22 onboarding to spend less time on background/history of cryptography, and more on why blockchains are resilient networks. Spend less time on the past and more on the present!
