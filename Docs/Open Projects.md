# Open Projects for OBG Members!
Here are a list of ambitious open projects for OBG members to work on. 

1. Improve [OBG DAO](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-DAO) (upgrading voting passes, encoding NFTs on-chain, bringing governance platform fully on-chain, custom frontend etc)
2. Create an OBG NFT museum
3. Start an up-only style podcast with guests from other Universities
4. Spin up a new fund with a new thesis (eg: not VC style investing, possibly uncorrelated returns or sector specific thesis ie: on-chain gaming) 
5. Migrate OBG full node from geth/prysm to minority clients (node is in the entrepreneurship center)
6. Upgrade our full node to a validator or spin up a validator for another chain
7. Implement a UASF of your choice to fork our node onto its own network (BIP 148 for guidance)
8. Implement cryptographic primitives in a language of your choice (hashing functions, PKI etc)
9. [Build an EVM from scratch](https://www.notion.so/Building-an-EVM-from-scratch-part-1-the-execution-context-c28ebb4200c94f6fb75948a5feffc686) using the yellow paper
