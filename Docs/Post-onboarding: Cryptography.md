## Probalistic Proofs for Verifiable Computation
Proof systems are a powerful primitive used for scalability and privacy. On the protocol level, blockchains uses them for [verifiable off-chain computation](https://starkware.co/) and [data availability commitments](https://www.eip4844.com/). On the application side, proofs are used for [data privacy](https://personaelabs.org/posts/personae/), incomplete information in videogames such as Dark Forest's [fog of war](https://dfwiki.net/wiki/Fog_of_war), and program correctness!

## MPC
Multi party computation is a way to distribute cryptographic processes across multiple individuals. This lets you distribute authority across multiple parties and compute results while allowing parties to withold data. [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) uses MPC for access control!
