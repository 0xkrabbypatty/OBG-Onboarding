## OBG Onboarding
Much thanks to the open source blockchain community for all of the resources used in this course! 

# Objectives
- Technical onboarding program that teaches blockchain best practices
- Emphasize the importance of running nodes and being careful of trust assumptions
- Turn new members into crypto natives!

# [Week1](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week1%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx.pdf): Introduction
- Icebreakers/member introductions
- Why crypto is interesting/what can you learn from it
- OBG requirements: deliverables, attendance?, conferences/socials
- OBG club structure
- OBG Onboarding overview
###### Homework: Setup twitter, discord, and spend 15 minutes scrolling on twitter

# [Week2](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week2%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx.pdf): What Problems were Blockchains Meant to Solve?
This lecture is based off of [this series](https://pet3rpan.medium.com/history-of-things-before-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-part-one-e199f02ca380)
- Why cryptography is important
- Diffie, Hellman, Merkle, and how public sector cryptography started
- What were the crypto wars
- Who were the cypherpunks
- What was the traffic analysis problem, how did it lead to the need for decentralized systems
- How do decentralized systems compliment cryptography
- Blockchains are for censorship resistance!
###### Homework: Put 5 things in discord that use cryptography, mess around with [online hashing](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html), watch overview of how [diffie-hellman works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI&ab_channel=Computerphile)

# [Week3](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week3%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx%20(1).pdf): What is a Blockchain and How Does it Work?
- Why do we care how blockchains work
- What is a blockchain
- Users: How to access blockchain (protocol spec vs. clients)? Network authorities (block producers vs. full nodes (sampling light nodes coming soon!))? Which nodes have the most power in the network? Bitcoin Indepedence Day and UASFs
- Consensus protocol: How did it start as a research field? What is the purpose? What was Satoshi's breakthrough in consensus? What is the importance of cryptoeconomics?
- State Machine: Consensus only orders transactions! Changes to state defined by VM
- Emphasize the importance of running a full node!
###### Homework: Read [this](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-independence-day-how-this-watershed-day-defines-community-consensus) and run a full node & generate private keys! [Bitcoin Instructions](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) | [Ethereum Instructions](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-script) Note: Ethereum requires an execution client and consensus client, these instructions use geth and pyrsm, both of which are go implementations of the ethereum spec. More instructions in the OBG discord!

# [Week4](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week4%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx%20(1).pdf): How to Use Dapps
- Revisiting virtual machines
- How dapps work: frontend vs backend
- What is onchain and what is offchain?
- How do your keys interact with dapps: RPC nodes, wallets, endpoints, and order flow
- FOSS 
- Censorship resistant dapps
- The endgame for dapps and fullnodes
###### Homework: Make a browser wallet (import private keys from the fullnode from last week!), store keys correctly, and use [uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) Extra: Use the dapps in the [OBG Fund 1.0 portfolio](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6089ce591463491d46fc001f/t/635051021c561e4224140cd1/1666208004354/Q4+Report.pdf) and connect metamask to local node!

# [Week5](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week5%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx.pdf): Why Blockchains? Social Consensus Improvement Proposals, Governance, and Contentious Forks
- We know blockchains are for censorship resistance but why should we build on one? 
- What guarantees does censorship resistance give us?
- How do these guarantees let us build [hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) 
- Upgrades, rollbacks, and when we want to change the protocol
- Improvement proposals, dev work, and governance process
###### Homework: Read and think about [Atoms, Institutions, and Blockchains](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0)
