## OBG Onboarding

# Objectives
- Technical onboarding program that teaches blockchain best practices
- Emphasize the importance of running nodes and being careful of trust assumptions
- Turn new members into crypto natives!

# [Week1](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week1%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx.pdf): Introduction
- Icebreakers/member introductions
- Why crypto is interesting/what can you learn from it
- OBG requirements: deliverables, attendance?, conferences/socials
- OBG club structure
- OBG Onboarding overview
###### Homework: Setup twitter, discord, and spend 15 minutes scrolling on twitter

# [Week2](https://github.com/0xkrabbypatty/OBG-Onboarding/blob/main/Slide%20Decks/Week2%20-%20OBG%20onboarding.pptx.pdf): What Problems do Blockchains Solve
This lecture is based off of [this series](https://pet3rpan.medium.com/history-of-things-before-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-part-one-e199f02ca380)
- Why encryption is important
- Diffie, Hellman, Merkle, and how public cryptography started
- What were the crypto wars
- Who were the cypherpunks
- What was the traffic analysis problem
- What problems do decentralized systems solve
- Blockchains are for censorship resistance
###### Homework: Put 5 things in discord that use cryptography, mess around with [online hashing](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html), watch overview of how [diffie-hellman works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI&ab_channel=Computerphile)

# Week3: What is a Blockchain
- Why do we care how blockchains work
- What is a blockchain
- Users (clients, role of full nodes, bitcoin independence day, UASFs)
- Consensus protocol (research, purpose, what Satoshi's breakthrough was, importance of cryptoeconomics)
- State Machine (consensus orders transactions, changes to state defined by VM, what is a VM?)
###### Homework: Run a full node & generate private keys! 
###### [Bitcoin Instructions](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)
###### [Ethereum Instructions](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-script) Note: Ethereum requires an execution client and consensus client, these insteructions use geth and pyrsm, both of which are go implementations of the ethereum spec

# Week4: How to Use a Blockchain
- Revisiting virtual machines
- How dapps work: frontend vs backend
- What is onchain and what is offchain?
- How do your keys interact with dapps: RPC nodes, wallets, endpoints, and order flow
- FOSS software
- Censorship resistant dapps
###### Homework: Make a browser wallet (import private keys from the fullnode from last week!), store keys correctly, and use [uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
###### Extra: Use the dapps in the [OBG Fund 1.0 portfolio](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6089ce591463491d46fc001f/t/635051021c561e4224140cd1/1666208004354/Q4+Report.pdf) and connect metamask to local node!

# Week5: Social Consensus - Improvement Proposals, Governance, and Contentious Forks
- Upgrades, rollbacks, and when we want to change the protocol
- Improvement proposals, dev work, and how to upgrade
- Chain ID and forks
- Replay attacks!
- Ethereum classic, Bitcoin cash, segwit, etc
###### Homework: One deliverable relating a non-crypto topic to an idea we covered in class!
