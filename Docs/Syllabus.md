## OBG Onboarding

# Objectives
- More technical onboarding program for OBG members than Mckeonâ€™s lecture series
- Emphasis on blockchains
- Teach new members web3 tools eg: run all program communication through discord, introduce to telegram/substack/twitter/docs/whitepapers/etherscan etc 
- IMPORTANT: Make a document w/ all homework & resources and pin in discord

# Week1: Introduction
- Icebreakers/member introductions
- Why crypto is interesting/what can you learn from it
- OBG requirements: deliverables, attendance?, conferences/socials
- OBG club structure
- OBG Onboarding overview
###### Homework: Setup twitter, discord, and spend 15 minutes scrolling on twitter

# Week2: What Problems do Blockchains Solve: Blockchain's Origin Story
- Why encryption is important
- Diffie, Hellman, Merkle, and how public cryptography started
- What were the crypto wars
- Who were the cypherpunks
- What was the traffic analysis problem
- What problems do decentralized systems solve
- Blockchains are for censorship resistance
- This lecture is based off of [this series](https://pet3rpan.medium.com/history-of-things-before-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-part-one-e199f02ca380)
###### Homework: Put 5 things in discord that use cryptography, mess around with [online hashing](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html), watch overview of how [diffie-hellman works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI&ab_channel=Computerphile)

# Week3: What is a Blockchain: Nodes versus Block Producers
- Why do we care how blockchains work
- What is a blockchain
- Users (clients, role of full nodes, bitcoin independence day, UASFs)
- Consensus protocol (research, purpose, what Satoshi's breakthrough was, importance of cryptoeconomics)
- State Machine (consensus orders transactions, changes to state defined by VM, what is a VM?)
###### Homework: Run a full node & generate private keys!

# Week4: How to Use a Blockchain: Blockchain Applications
- Revisiting virtual machines
- How dapps work: frontend vs backend
- What is onchain and what is offchain?
- How do your keys interact with dapps: RPC nodes, wallets, endpoints, and order flow
- FOSS software
- Censorship resistant dapps
###### Homework: Make a browser wallet (import private keys from the fullnode from last week!), store keys correctly, and use [uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
###### Extra: Use the dapps in the [OBG fund 1.0 portfolio](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6089ce591463491d46fc001f/t/635051021c561e4224140cd1/1666208004354/Q4+Report.pdf)!

# Week5: Social Consensus: Improvement Proposals, Governance, and Contentious Forks
- Upgrades, rollbacks, and when we want to change the protocol
- Improvement proposals, dev work, and how to upgrade
- Chain ID and forks
- Ethereum classic, Bitcoin cash, segwit, etc
###### Homework: One deliverable relating a non-crypto topic to an idea we covered in class!
